				<p class="text-bold text-center">This document describes some aspects about the implementation design of the REST Web Service and choices made.</p>

				<p class="margin-top-2">With the exception of NFFG for which it is possible to "suggest" a name to be assigned (if not available a new one is generated), all HOST and LINK names are generated univocally and autonomously by the web service. It should be noted that even though the NFFGs and LINKs names are therefore not required in the requested body, NODEs necessarily require a specified unique name throughout the NFFG body (generated sequentially or randomly) so as to be able to distinguish link membership to respective node (see API Documentation for an exmple). These node's names, when allocating the NFFG into the system, will be converted to actual names and returned to the client inside the response body.</p>

				<p>Regarding the GET of the resource "/nffgs", I decided to return a simple list of nffg (without nodes and links) in order to avoid messages that are too big to process and transmit. Same choice was taken for the GET of the resource "/hosts" which returns a simple list of hosts without the relative nodes allocated on them. To obtain complete information about the single nffg or the single host it is sufficient to perform a GET to the child resource by adding the {id} of the desired element.</p>
				
				<p>Not being entirely clear in the assignment text, it was assumed that a link is already present in the NFFG if there is a link that has the same source and destination node of the link that you want to add. This same assumption is done about the deploy of an entire NFFG: there can be only one link connecting a srcNode to a dstNode (so two links in both direction).</p>

				<p>The link overwrite functionality, provided by system specifications, has been implemented by introducing an optional attribute within the LINK element. The name of this boolean attribute is "overwrite"; if not specified within the link element the value assumed will be "false".</p>
